# CaseCount
This React app is a Case Counter that allows users to add custom cases, increment their counts, and view percentage distributions. Each case is saved locally with a random RGB color and persists via localStorage. The app is responsive and includes a feature to export case data as a CSV file for further analysis. ðŸš€
